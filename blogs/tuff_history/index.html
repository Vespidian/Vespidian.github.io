<h1 id="my-journey-making-a-3d-game-engine">My Journey Making a 3D Game
Engine</h1>
<p>Alternatively titled "The process of realizing I'm making an engine
instead of a game."</p>
<p>All art shown is created by me and all videos, gifs, and images are
created by me using the Tuff game engine.</p>
<p>When I first started making a game in 2020, I barely knew any C. All
I had done up to that point was write an x86 bootloader in assembly,
naively attempt to do recreate Garrys's Mod in Unity using C# and play
around with making some command line C programs.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="foxandbox">FoxandBox</h3>
<p>My first early dive into game and engine development was heavily
influenced by Stardew Valley and the Pokemon games. Everything from the
tile based level to the art style. The name came from the main character
being a fox and the game being a sandbox (such creativity!).</p>
<p><img src="Images/particleSystem.gif" /></p>
<p>I started off using just SDL2 and learned everything from <a
href="https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/">Lazy Foo's tutorials</a> My
language of choice was C and that has remained. This is - logically
speaking - a somewhat odd choice but its just personal preference for
the simplicity and control I have with C. I could just as easily have
done all of this in something more suitable like C++ <em>but wheres the
fun in that?</em></p>
<p><img src="Images/speed.gif" /></p>
<p>The first thing I did was create the world of the game. This was
initially a finite square grid of fixed size which I later expanded to a
chunked system for near infinite world sizes.</p>
<p>After level creation and movement was in a usable state, I worked on
level interaction and automatic calculation of the borders between tile
types. I did these calculations using a method similar to a cellular
automaton. Each configuration of the 8 neighbours of a tile is assigned
an index into the tile map below. This later proved to not work too well
for intersections of more than 2 materials, but for 2 materials the
effect is quite nice. <img src="Images/autotile_mask.png" /> <img
src="Images/fasterEditing.gif" /></p>
<p>I took a crack at developing an immediate mode* (as opposed to a
retained mode**) user interface library from scratch for this project
which I used for the inventory and menus. Designing a good UI library is
hard.. You'll see this theme come up a couple times again when I talk
about my 3D engine as well. The UI of this game was very bare bones and
crude but it worked well enough for my uses. * An immediate mode UI is
one which is updated and drawn every frame ** A retained mode UI is a
set of states and objects which store the elements of the UI. This
allows for positions to be computed a single time and used over many
frames if nothing changes.</p>

href="Images/checkbox.mp4">Video</a></video></p>
<p>I then used this UI system to make a cute little inventory system
which served absolutely no purpose. Well, it would've served a purpose
if i'd had any planning for the direction the game should've taken. But,
alas, I had no idea what I was doing.</p>
<p><video src="Images/itemDrop.mp4" controls=""><a

<p>This project was ended when I attempted to expand the game to support
a fully procedurally generated map. By this point the code base was a
mess and memory leaks were popping up like a game of whack-a-mole (I got
pretty far considering this was my first project of this scale).</p>
<p>Although this game never ended up coming to anything, it taught me an
incredible amount about basic programming, C, and engine development.
This game is the catalyst which later drove me to make a 3D game engine.
I deem this project a success. Even though there was no end goal to
begin with, it was a necessary stepping stone.</p>

<h3 id="tuff---the-first-attempt">Tuff - The first attempt</h3>
<p>Insert why switch to openGL</p>
<p>Originally, the only reason i wanted to switch to opengl was so I
could rotate sprites (which sdl2 can't do), This temptation along with
all the other possibilities I saw OpenGL could bring made me eventually
bite the bullet and switch over. Very quickly after achieving my goal of
rotating sprites I wanted to see what else I could do with OpenGL; I
didn't know it then but this would be the end of FoxandBox.</p>
<p><img src="Images/opengl_renderer.gif" /> <img
src="Images/slider.gif" /></p>
<p>I used the wonderfully well made site <a
href="https://learnopengl.com/">LearnOpenGL</a> by Joey de Vries to
start learning basic 3D rendering. Once I'd gotten a fairly loose grasp
on using OpenGL and toyed around with writing some shaders, I had a
realization. I no longer wanted to make a game, I wanted to make a game
engine.</p>
<p>By this point I had a comfortable grasp of <em>most</em> of C and
abided by a fair amount of good coding practices - or so I thought. I
went through and worked my way through the tutorial series. Starting off
with .obj 3D model parsing / loading. Doing this early on helped
immensely with mentally mapping from a 3D object and its triangles to
the vertex data the GPU takes in.</p>
<p><video src="Images/crate.mp4" controls=""><a
href="Images/crate.mp4">Video</a></video></p>
<p>I followed the tutorials up to the point of basic specular lighting
and then toyed around with some different models and normal / bump
maps.</p>
<p><video src="Images/more_lighting.mp4" controls=""><a
href="Images/more_lighting.mp4">Video</a></video> <video
src="Images/shiny.mp4" controls=""><a
href="Images/shiny.mp4">Video</a></video></p>
<p>I then polished up the look of everything - taking some notes from
Blender's UI - and spent a while messing around with shaders to get the
overall program into a more presentable package. <video
src="Images/game_engine.mp4" controls=""><a
href="Images/game_engine.mp4">Video</a></video> <video
src="Images/pretty.mp4" controls=""><a
href="Images/pretty.mp4">Video</a></video></p>
<p>Now comes the second attempt at a UI library. This time I went with a
retained mode UI and modeled it after a combination of html and css. I
used <a href="https://github.com/zserge/jsmn">JSMN</a> to tokenize JSON
files and then parsed the contents from there. UI files contained a
style section for element classes and a hierarchical scene section for
the elements themselves. Classes can be applied to elements when loaded
from a file and classes can be applied to elements upon hovering or
clicking. <video src="Images/ui_menu.mp4" controls=""><a
href="Images/ui_menu.mp4">Video</a></video> A goal of mine at this point
was to make every resource (models, textures, shaders) easily hot
re-loadable. This included UI and I managed to get it to a point where
it was usable enough to drastically speed up UI prototyping. <video
src="Images/ui_colours.mp4" controls=""><a
href="Images/ui_colours.mp4">Video</a></video></p>
<p>This second attempt at a UI system worked great. But alas, eventually
my ignorance of memory leaks caught up to me and impossible to track
down bugs started popping up. <video src="Images/sentient_ui.mp4"
controls=""><a href="Images/sentient_ui.mp4">Video</a></video></p>
<p>If I wanted to have a usable program with hot reloading and no memory
leaks, I needed to change up my approach. So I started to modularize as
much as I could; I wrote completely independent libraries for each part
of the engine (e.g. mesh loading, shader processing, ui layout, etc).
The intention was to write and test each module by itself and then
combine them all into the final engine.</p>
<p>I think this approach ended up being the most flexible for me, as
well as being incredibly easy to scale. As long as I kept the interface
between modules the same, I could completely overhaul individual modules
and no other piece of code would be affected. One downside is that it
takes slightly more initial planning to make sure interfaces are fully
fleshed out from the beginning, since any changes to the interface will
affect other modules.</p>
<p>This modular approach also makes visualizing the dependencies between
modules easier, since all dependencies are <code>#include</code>-ed at
the top of each file.</p>
<p>I've also started to use this approach with embedded systems
programming projects I'm doing. For example, I now have individual
libraries for each peripheral (UART, IR comms, I2C).</p>
<hr />
<p>With the most recent attempt at a UI I started off by focusing on the
functionality of laying out elements before even thinking about visual
things like radiused corners or the parsing and serializing aspects.
This meant I ended up splitting the UI module into multiple sub-modules
which can each work almost independently as well.</p>
<p>I used pretty much the same file format for UI files as with the
previous attempt.</p>
<p><video src="Images/particle_sim.mp4" controls=""><a
href="Images/particle_sim.mp4">Video</a></video> To showcase this
version as well as the engine itself, I made a molecular dynamics
simulation program which displays a 3D rendering of molecules as
physical simulation of atomic collisions is carried out.</p>
<p><video src="Images/octane_sim.mp4" controls=""><a
href="Images/octane_sim.mp4">Video</a></video> The intention with this
program being to one day be able to simulate protein folding and render
it in real time. But I'm in slightly over my head with this; So I chose
to limit the scope and simulate only smaller simpler molecules for
now.</p>
